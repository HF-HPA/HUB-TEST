philodendron,Philodendron,Philodendron spp.,,"Medium to bright indirect light; avoid harsh direct afternoon sun which can scorch leaves.","Water when the top 3 cm (1 in) of soil are dry. Keep evenly moist in growing season but never soggy; reduce watering in winter.","Prefers 50–70% humidity but tolerates typical indoor levels if kept away from heating vents.","Ideal 18–27°C (65–80°F); avoid cold drafts and temperatures below about 15°C (59°F).","Loose, well‑draining aroid mix with peat or coco coir, bark, and perlite for both moisture and aeration.","Feed every 4–6 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced, diluted houseplant fertilizer; little to none in winter.","Mildly to moderately toxic if ingested (calcium oxalate). Keep away from pets and children that chew plants.","Provide a moss pole or stake for climbing types; rotate regularly for even growth and wipe dust from leaves so they can photosynthesize efficiently."
ferns,"Ferns (indoor types)","Various fern genera (Adiantum, Nephrolepis, Asplenium, etc.)",,"Bright to medium indirect light; no direct sun which quickly scorches delicate fronds.","Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Never allow the root ball to fully dry; reduce slightly in winter.","High humidity 60–80% is ideal; group plants, use pebble trays or a humidifier, especially for maidenhair and other fine‑leaf species.","Most indoor ferns prefer 16–24°C (60–75°F) with no cold drafts or sudden temperature swings.","Rich, moisture‑retentive but airy mix with peat or coco, compost, and perlite; avoid heavy, compacted soils.","Feed lightly every 4–6 weeks during active growth with a dilute balanced fertilizer; ferns are sensitive to overfertilizing.","Many common indoor ferns are non‑toxic, but species vary; when in doubt, treat as potentially unsafe for pets to chew.","Brown, crispy fronds usually point to low humidity or underwatering. Trim damaged foliage and maintain steady moisture and humidity for best appearance."
pothos,Pothos,"Epipremnum aureum and cultivars",,"Low to bright indirect light; variegated forms hold color best in medium to bright filtered light.","Water when the top 3–5 cm (1–2 in) of soil are dry. Very forgiving of the occasional missed watering; avoid constantly wet soil.","Average home humidity (40–60%) is fine; appreciates a bit more but does not require it.","Ideal 18–27°C (65–80°F); avoid temperatures below 12–13°C (mid‑50s°F).","Standard well‑draining potting mix with added perlite or bark to prevent compaction.","Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced fertilizer diluted to half strength.","Toxic if ingested (calcium oxalate); keep out of reach of pets and children.","Great as a hanging or climbing plant. Leggy growth indicates it needs more light; prune vines to encourage fuller, bushier growth and easily propagate cuttings in water."
